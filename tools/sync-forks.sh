# Keep lavavex's forks of the dependencies current, and show what is new upstream.
#
# 1. Fast-forwards each fork's default branch from its upstream (gh repo sync), so the
#    forks hold everything upstream has, even if upstream later disappears.
# 2. For each dependency, lists the upstream commits after the revision pinned in
#    tools/fetch-deps.sh. Pins never move here: bump one by hand (fetch-deps.sh and
#    PINS.md), rebuild with tools/bootstrap.sh and test on the console.
# 3. Says how many RPCS3 master commits the ps5 branch lacks (rebase it to pick them up).
#
# Needs gh, signed in with access to lavavex's repos. A fork whose branch has diverged
# from upstream is reported, never force-updated.
